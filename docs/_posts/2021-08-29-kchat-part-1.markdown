This is part-1 of a series of articles on creating a chat application using Kafka and Blazor.

## What will we cover

The list of topics is as follows.

1. **Getting Kafka Instance**
1. [Creating the Blazor app]({% post_url 2021-08-30-kchat-part-2 %})
1. Creating Kafka Producer and Consumer
1. Containerizing the application

## Reasons

Recently I got involved in learning more about Kafka and as usual I got bored after watching a few videos. So I thought the best way to learn is to create a simple application.

### Why Chat ?

Chat application is a good candidate for event streaming platform without requiring use of complex techniques like handling transactional commits, message delivery and being eventually consistent.

### Why Blazor ?

Blazor seems like a simple way to create a real time streaming application for the web (via signal-r).

## Source Code

The source code can be found in github [here](https://github.com/TalalTayyab/kchat). The code is divided into different branches where each branch has code specific to a certain functionality.
This way the code can also be used in a workshop.

Branch|Description|
|-|-|
[Main](https://github.com/TalalTayyab/Kchat/tree/main)|Readme file that describes how to get a free Kafka instance
[First](https://github.com/TalalTayyab/Kchat/tree/first)|Layout of the Blazor app
[Second](https://github.com/TalalTayyab/Kchat/tree/second)|Add Kafka code
[Third](https://github.com/TalalTayyab/Kchat/tree/third)|Add web project into docker compose to simulate multiple client instances

Before we go any further, lets talk about set up.

## Prerequisites

1. NET Core 5
1. Kafka
1. Visual Studio (for debuging)
1. Optional - Docker (linux container enabled)

## Getting Kafka Instance

This section will discuss options on how to get a Kafka instance.

### Locally using Docker-compose

Note: Requires Docker with support for linux containers.

1. Run `docker-compose up -d` in the `\kchat` folder and wait for it to complete.
1. Download the Kafka GUI [tool](https://kafkatool.com/download.html) aka Offset explorer
1. Open the Offset Explorer tool and Add a new connection `File -> Add New Connection`
1. Enter Cluster name example localhost - `Properties -> Cluster Name`
1. Enter bootstrap server `localhost:29092` (this is where Kafka is running) - `Advanced -> Bootstrap servers`
1. Press Test Connection and Yes to add connection.

### Free Cloud Kafka instance

1. Browse to [CloudKafka](https://www.cloudkarafka.com/plans.html)
1. Scroll all the way down until you see Developer Duck Free account
1. Follow through the process to get a free instance of Kafka.
