Hi,

My name is Talal Tayyab. I live in Melbourne, Australia.

I've been involved in coding since the mid-90's where I used to play around on Commodore 64. However I got a true passion for development during my Computer Science degree.

Creating software gives me great satisfaction and pleasure. Its more than a hobby. However once I start on a project, its very hard to put it down and ends up taking majority of my time.

I am creating this place to note down my experiences, firstly for myself , and secondly to share with the wider community.

Let's see how it goes!
